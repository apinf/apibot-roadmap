# APInf-bot
This is API management ChatBot which can be used by API consumers (developers/APIOps) and API owners (APItalist). This project is selected as one of the side tracks in APInf Oy development. This project is an experiment through which we gain insight about the needs and opportunities in this realm. Development will be open and code will be open source (MIT). 


## Short term aim  

Evaluate API bot idea by implementing PoC level bot. Take it into use with apinf.io API management and collect feedback from customers and developer community. 

At this stage it is developed against two systems: 

- APInf.io API management and 
- Chat environment (to be selected soon)

## Long term aim  
Eventually aim is to make generally used API bot that can be integrated to various chat environments such as Slack and HipChat and API management systems such as 3Scale, AWS API management and Azure API management. We are not excluding IRC integration either. 

## Why - reasoning for doing this
First of all, it's intriguing idea. It is something we haven't seen yet (at least not open source). It fits our thinking about supporting APIOps (API value tool chain automation). Besides Chatbots are cool.  

## Roadmap 2017

- By end of Feb: Design PoC features (in issues)
- By end of Feb: Select chat environment and open source bot engine to use
- During March: Implementation 
- During April- June: Testing and collecting feedback
- July: Evaluation of results and decision about future
