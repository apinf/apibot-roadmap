# APInf-bot
This is API management ChatBot which can be used by API consumers (developers/APIOps) and API owners (APItalist). This project is selected as one of the side tracks in APInf Oy development. This project is an experiment through which we gain insight about the needs and opportunities in this realm. 


## Short term aim  

Evaluate API bot idea by implementing PoC level bot. Take it into use with apinf.io API management and collect feedback from customers and developer community. 

At this stage it is developed against two systems: 

- APInf.io API management and 
- Chat environment (to be selected soon)

## Long term aim  
Eventually aim is to make generally used API bot that can be integrated to various chat environments why not even IRC.
